This library provides quick access to basic functions of LIDAR-Lite
via the Arduino interface. Additionally, it can provide a user of any
platform with a template for their own application code.

For detailed specifications, pinout, and connection diagrams, see the manuals linked at the above product pages.

***A Note on Compatibility:*** *Minor interface changes have occurred between LIDAR-Lite v3, v3HP, and previous versions. Backwards-compatibility of this library is largely preserved, though support is not directly provided for v1 and v2.*

## Installation instructions
To install, download this repository and place in your Arduino libraries folder or use the Arduino Library Manager. If you need help, follow the instructions here: [http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

## Example Sketches
### v3/GetDistancePWM
This is the simplest demonstration of LIDAR-Lite. It shows how to read a distance using the PWM interface.

### v3/GetDistanceI2c
This demonstration shows how to read distance using the I2C interface and choose preset configurations.

### v3/ShortRangeHighSpeed
This example shows a method to run LIDAR-Lite at high speed for short range applications. It combines a variety of settings to trade off range and accuracy for very fast measurements.

### v3HP/v3HP_I2C
This example shows various methods to run LIDAR-Lite v3HP.
